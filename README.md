# Startup Proxy

Startup proxy is a app that comunicates with Kubernetes API server to scale up and down resources that can be used temporarely (Ex: Gogs, Gitlab, Jenkins, Concourse CI, Bookstack, LDAP Admin, etc...). With Startup proxy resources are scaled down to 0 replicas when you are not using it, and scaled up when you access it imediately.

My cluster has some pretty heavy batch jobs that run at night, resources like CI, version control dont need to be up and running at this point.
